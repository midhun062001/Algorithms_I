*   Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire
    straits and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. They arrange themselves
    in a circle (at positions numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle,
    eliminating every Mth person until only one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus
    figured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated. Write a Queue client Josephus that
    takes N and M from the command line and prints out the order in which people are
    eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
